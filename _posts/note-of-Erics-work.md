## content

Observe quasi-two-dimensional *levy flight* in a rotating tank filled with water under 2 modes---coherent structure (vortices & jets); non-coherent structures(weakly turbulent). And discuss the theory link the random flight $PDF$ with anomalous diffusion exponent $\gamma$.



## intro

1. Brownian motion & Levy flights

2. History & examples of Brownian motion

   - dye molecule in water

   - electrons in wire (with voltage on)

     **  Note that Levy flight is a kind of random walk; random stirring (like turbulent flows)could make the mixing random walks on a **macroscopic** scale 

3. History & sort & examples of Levy flights

     **   Note that Levy flight is self-similar 

4. Math base of Brownian motion---Central Limit Theorem

   - define $D$ in terms of  individual particle
   - define relationship between $D, l $ and $ T$
   - calculate $PDF$----calculate $<l^2>$---calculate $MSD$

5. Focus

   - random walk whose $<l^2>=inf$ , in other words, CLT is no longer suitable



## EXP.
